This app works using the Giphy API. I used mostly javascript & Jquery to create the displaying of the giphs after pulling them from the Giphy API. Majority of the menu buttons and dashboard were not created dynammically but just edit a handful of globally stored variables.

When a giph that has been loaded into the page you can click -3 or +3 to remove the last 3 giphs or add 3 giphs. You can also click the number 12 menu button and it will reset the items back to 12 giphs like at the start of a button click.

When you click a giph that has been loaded into the page it will toggle it from looping or staying still.
